				We supply chemical offerings that cut across the oil and gas (IOW) both
				upstream Oil & Gas producers. This is cost effective, providing clients
				with tailor-made chemical solutions that meet international and approved
				disposal specifications, curtail downtime, enhance production output,
				reduce operational risks regardless of whether it is onshore or
				offshore. Oil & Gas producers face many challenges which hinder and
				limit their production and maintain safety. We solve these challenges
				using sophisticated chemical and scientific technology to improve
				production performance.
