					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p>

				<Styles.HaulageServiceList>
					<h2>Our approach</h2>
					<h4>We create safe working environments by:</h4>
					<p>
						Instilling the highest possible level of safety awareness in
						everyone involved in storing, moving and delivering our fuel,
						whether that person is a member of staff or employed by a contractor
						or sub-contractor. Encouraging and empowering every individual
						working in the business to observe and report hazards, near misses
						or unwanted events, however small, without fear of blame.
					</p>
					<p>
						Responding quickly to identified trends and near-misses in order to
						prevent more significant incidents or injuries. Ensuring that every
						individual working in our business is properly trained for the work
						they do.
					</p>
				</Styles.HaulageServiceList>
				<Styles.HaulageServiceList>
					<h2> Driver safety</h2>
					<p>
						We take every possible step to ensure our drivers, vehicles and
						equipment are prepared for all foreseeable hazards.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our drivers carry hazardous product on the public highway and
						operate around members of the public at customer forecourts. It is
						of paramount importance that they are equipped and competent for the
						tasks they perform.
					</p>
					<p>
						To ensure the safety of our drivers and those around them, we
						provide ongoing training and assessment, exceeding industry norms,
						to ensure that safety standards on the road, in the terminal and at
						the customer site are maintained.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our drivers are best placed to observe safety hazards in our
						logistics operations. Many channels of communication exist within
						the company, both formal and informal, to ensure that individual
						drivers' observations and experience are shared and improvement
						actions put in place.
					</p>
				</Styles.HaulageServiceList>
				<Styles.HaulageServiceList>
					<h2>Creating a culture of incident reporting</h2>
					<p>
						Across the company we strongly encourage a culture of open and
						honest reporting of all unwanted events as part of a "no-blame"
						culture.
					</p>
					<p>
						We focus on capturing the near misses and hazards observations that
						can easily remain un-noticed and un-reported in a business. We also
						conduct regular audits throughout the business to identify gaps and
						put action plans in place to resolve.
					</p>
					<p>
						Information from these observations is vitally important for us in
						understanding safe working practices and in identifying and
						correcting potential issues that have potential to lead to serious
						injuries or events in the future.
