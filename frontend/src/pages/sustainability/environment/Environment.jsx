								Joshcalebwill has long recognised the climate challenge and the
								role of energy in enabling a decent quality of life. We believe
								that, while technological developments will emerge, effective
								policy and cultural change is essential to drive low-carbon
								business and consumer choices and opportunities.
							</p>
							<p>
								Joshcalebwill supports the establishment of government-led
								carbon ‚Äúpricing‚Äù mechanisms that deliver a meaningful cost on
								CO2 emissions, necessary to create transitions to lower-carbon
								power and fuel options.

							<h2>Preventing spills</h2>
							<p>
								Oil or product spills damage the environment and endanger our
								employees and neighbouring communities. To avoid spills and
								leaks of hazardous substances, we work hard to make sure our
								facilities are well designed, safely operated, and appropriately
								inspected and maintained. We invest in the equipment and human
								expertise we need to deal with any spills that happen.
							</p>

							<h2>Air quality</h2>
							<p>
								Producing and using fossil fuels can affect air quality. We have
								developed more efficient transport fuels for customers and
								focused on improving motorists‚Äô fuel efficiency. We also work to
								reduce air pollution from our operations, including limiting
								emissions of nitrogen oxide, sulphur dioxide and volatile
								organic compounds.

							<h2>Fresh water</h2>
							<p>
								We take steps to manage our use of water and apply new
								approaches and technologies to reduce our use of fresh water. We
								comply with water regulations wherever we operate and also set
								our own mandatory water standards, which match best practice for
								our industry.
							</p>
							<p>
								We tailor our use of fresh water to local conditions, as water
								constraints tend to affect people at the local or regional
								level. In some cases, we use alternatives to fresh water in our
								operations; these include recycled water, processed sewage water
								and desalinated water.

						<Copy>
							<h2>Biodiversity</h2>
							<p>
								Our projects can affect local biodiversity and dependent
								communities. We apply stringent standards to help reduce any
								impacts our operations may have, particularly in critical
								habitats, which are areas that are rich in biodiversity or under
								protection.
							</p>
							<p>
								We work with several conservation organisations, including
								Earthwatch, the International Union for Conservation of Nature,
								The Nature Conservancy, and Wetlands International. Our projects
								with biodiversity partners include working to restore natural
								habitats and ecosystems close to our operations.
